This design already implements data collection by asking for coordinates, dates, and names of the earthquakes. This can be seen on the upper right of the page. This will then show data from a seperate database that will show specifics of the said earthquake. The tools on the side will be used to show layers such as tectonic plates, latest earthquakes, etc. We will also implement a drawing tool to those who wish to triangulate the earthquake themselves or for a more general purpose.
